          </h1>
          <p id="isPasted">As previously stated, benzodiazepines are drugs with the classification of depressants. Depressants are responsible for the reduction of stimulation, which affects the nervous system, more specifically the CNS, slowing down the communication between the brain and the body. In the case of benzodiazepines, they are known to produce sedation, which is a class of drugs that can slow brain activity. As a result of its ability to slow down the brain, it also produces a calming effect, which is also why benzodiazepines are frequently prescribed for anxiety and insomnia.</p>
          <p>When regarding the symptoms/side effects of using benzodiazepines, here is a list of some of the most common:</p>
        </div>
        <ul class="u-text u-text-2">
          <li> Drowsiness&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Light-headedness&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Confusion&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Slurred Speech&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Muscle Weakness</li>
          <li>Memory Problems</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="u-text u-text-3">When considering these side effects, the majority of them can be explained by explaining how benzodiazepines work. As previously mentioned, benzodiazepines interact with GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), which is a type of inhibitory neurotransmitter. As benzodiazepines mimic the neurotransmitter GABA, it decreases the ability of neurotransmitters to interact with other neurons through inhibiting them in the synapses. As the neurotransmitter is hyperpolarized, it further increases the need for excitatory neurotransmitters to reach the action threshold.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>The prevention of action potentials from occurring can explain the symptoms of muscle weakness and, potentially, slurred speech as it makes it more difficult to reach the threshold potential. And as for drowsiness, light-headedness, confusion, and slurred speech again, those are the effects of benzodiazepines' slowing down the brain's connection to the body, which is also responsible for benzodiazepines' therapeutic effects, as it is often used to treat anxiety and insomnia.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>When regarding memory problems related to benzodiazepines, this may be due to benzodiazepines' known property of possessing anterograde amnesic properties. These anterograde amnesic properties refer to benzodiazepines' ability to disrupt both short-term and long-term memory function. When talking about anterograde amnesic properties, it refers to anterograde amnesia, which is a type of memory loss that is characterized by when a person is unable to form new memories. As to how this is caused, it may be due to benzodiazepine interactions with GABA, as within a study, it was shown that altered releases of neurotransmitters produce amnesia. Delving deeper, one of the types of neurotransmitter GABA effects, including benzodiazepines as well, is that it also affects acetylcholine by reducing the impact of acetylcholine on a neuron as it is hyperpolarized. The effect of low levels of acetylcholine is that its side effects include blurry vision, confusion, hallucinations, and memory loss, which could explain memory problems caused by benzodiazepines. Another correlation between low levels of acetylcholine and memory problems is that in patients with Alzheimer's disease, a type of dementia, it was found that there were decreased levels of acetylcholine, further suggesting or supporting that these altered releases or reduced releases of neurotransmitters reaching the postsynaptic neuron, such as acetylcholine, could cause memory-related problems.&nbsp;<br>

        <p class="u-text u-text-3">
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Explanation&nbsp;</span>
          <br>
          <br>Benzodiazepine does not affect the release or reuptake of neurotransmitters. Rather they mimic a neurotransmitter called GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), a type of inhibitory neurotransmitter. GABA as an inhibitory neurotransmitter, their main function is believed to be the reduction of neuronal excitability.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>In the simple animation, without the benzodiazepines, the synaptic vesicles released the neurotransmitter. The neurotransmitters as well as GABA the inhibitory neurotransmitter diffused across the synapse. When GABA is diffused it then binds to the receptor, and when that is done a negatively charged molecule goes through the receptor. The negatively charged molecule is a chloride ion.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>In the section with benzodiazepines, when the synaptic vesicles released the neurotransmitter the drug benzodiazepine appeared and just like GABA, it also binded to the receptor. Where in this case instead of only one Cl- entering the receptor multiple chlorine ions did. These negatively charge molecules affect the other neurotransmitters, particularly excitatory, as they hyperpolarize further the neuron, meaning this hyperpolarization causes the potential of an action potential to decrease as the neuron now needing more excitatory neurotransmitters to reach its threshold potential to cause an action potential.&nbsp;
