        <p class="u-text u-text-2"><b>Benzodiazepines is a drug with a drug classification of depressants. Benzodiazepines are known to produce sedation, which is a category of drugs that can slow brain activity, therefore having effects such as sleep inducing effects, as well as being able to relieve anxiety, muscle spasms, and reduce or prevent seizures. Benzodiazepine can treat a variety of drugs, however, they are often prescribed to patients to treat anxiety, seizures and insomnia.&nbsp;</b>

        <p class="u-text u-text-2"><b>Benzodiazepines interact with GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), a type of inhibitory neurotransmitter, which inhibits neurotransmitters by blocking certain brain signals, therefore decreasing activity within the nervous system. This relates to benzodiazepine, as it is believed to enhance the binding of GABA to its receptors, which are responsible for receiving chemical messages that inhibit or reduce nerve impulses. Through enhancing the bind of GABA, it slows down the body’s response to stimulus, affecting the heart rate and breathing by slowing them down, causing other parts of the body to slow down as well, causing muscle relaxation, clearing of thoughts or emotions, easing anxiety, etc. This therapeutic effect makes an individual feel a feeling of being in a state of an euphoric experience or a "high," as seen in other drugs such as cannabis, which could explain the cause of dependency and how it occurs.</b>

          </h1>
          <p id="isPasted">When it comes to treating the symptoms and side effects caused by benzodiazepines, it is advised to discontinue the use of benzodiazepines. However, it is easier said than done. In benzodiazepine rehabilitation, it is mainly done through a series of reductions in the amount of benzodiazepine taken. The amount that is reduced is often subjective, varying case by case, depending on the type of user; whether they are long-term, short-term, or even chronic users; and usually, the longer you've relied on or used the drug, the harder it will be to quit.</p>
          <p>
            <br>
          </p>
          <p>In terms of benzodiazepine reduction, there are many different ways in which you could do that. There have been many different agencies which have implemented their own guidelines as to how you should reduce benzodiazepine intake. One of these agencies is the National Center for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. In their reduction guidelines for dosages, it is suggested for bedtime therapeutic dose users to reduce the dosage by approximately 25% every week. Whereas for users of supratherapeutic doses, those who consume greater levels of what would be normally administered in treatment, such as chronic users, it was suggested to initially reduce the dosage by 25–30%, then reduce the dosage by approximately 5–10% daily to weekly.</p>
          <p>
            <br>
          </p>
          <p>Using this method of dosage reduction, it will be able to treat symptoms and side effects produced by benzodiazepines. However, it will not be able to fully treat all symptoms and side effects. One of the previously stated side effects of benzodiazepines was memory problems. When referring to memory problems caused by benzodiazepines, although the discontinuation of benzodiazepines does show recovery of function in areas of the brain, there still remains a significant amount of impairment in areas of cognition of the brain. This means that despite withdrawal from using benzodiazepines, a total reversal of all side-effects like memory problems is most likely not possible. However, withdrawal from using benzodiazepines does still show recovery to an extent.</p>
